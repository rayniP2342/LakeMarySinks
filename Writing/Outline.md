# This is the outline for a draft paper of Lake Mary Sink hole analysis

**Intro**
- Location: Flagstaff, Colorado Plateau
  Lower Lake Mary study area has 20 identified sinkholes within the study area that have been well catalogued in a long-term sinkhole inventory since 2018. Biannually, the sinkholes were visited
characterized by hydrogeology students to be measured and inventoried in 2018, 2020, 2022, and 2024. Over the years, some sinkholes have become plugged with sediment to a degree that they ceased taking water, and researchers had difficulty identifying six of the catalogued sinkholes in 2022 due to the changing geomorphology of the landscape. Other sinkholes- specifically those in the northern reach of the study area-  have widened or deepened. Several sinks in the eastern most section have evolved from shallow depressions or flat ground and evolved into pronounced depressions on the landscape.

- Geology: lithology and structural trends
  The study area is in Northern Arizona, 15 km (9.4 miles) southeast of the City of Flagstaff. The region is part of the Colorado Plateau which spans the four corners region of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona and is characterized by considerable uplift which predominantly took place during the Laramide Orogeny in the Late Cretaceous (REFERENCE).
  The study area overlaps with the San Francisco Volcanic field, which covers about 4,700 km 2 (1,800 mi 2 ) in the areas between Williams AZ, Flagstaff AZ, and the Grand Canyon (USGS, 2018). Basalt flows from cinder cones and other volcanic eruptions cap the local Moenkopi formation and Kaibab limestone. Thin layers of Quaternary alluvium accumulate at various thicknesses in local low points like Marshall Lake and the nearby Lake Mary. Few geological units are present within the study area, as Lower Lake Mary is comprised of Quaternary alluvium in the lake bed and adjacent elevations, and Permian Kaibab Limestone outcrops in the eastern parts of the study area. No basalt flows are present within the study area.
- add site map with geology
The study area falls within a region characterized by extremely high occurrences of jointing (Chavez et al, 1997). More recent evidence from drill logs, and several geophysical investigations provided additional evidence for the depth, and direction of these joints (Bills et.al, 2020).
Faulting within the Lake Mary Graben and wider Colorado Plateau sees trends of faults running in two directions, northeast and northwest. While only the southwestern edge of the Lake Mary graben is presently identified in the study area, known sinkholes also follow this pattern.
Bills et al (2020) also provided a conceptual model for reverse drag structures propegating from deeper crust through through the surface. 
- Hydrogeology? (if relevant)

- Climate
  The Flagstaff area is a semi-arid environment that generally receives between 450 to 560mm (18-22 inches) of precipitation annually (Iowa State, 2024). The groundwater recharge for the area is predominantly a snowmelt driven system, with 60% of the annual precipitation coming from snow and rain during the winter months. Most precipitation falls as snow between December and February, but seasonal summer monsoons can contribute up to 40% of the annual precipitation from rainfall runoff between July and August (CITE)
  
- Other geotechnical information (if relevant)
- A recent resistivity study also identified the values observed in this region as correlating with unjointed and crystalline limestone, karst limestone, and friable sandstone (Bills et. al,2020). This is consistent with the hydro stratigraphic units for the region.

**Methods**
Data collected on several dates

- timeline?: data collection, and dam break

-   Sink hole inventory
  
- Ground Penetrating Radar
  Data for this project was collected using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR). A shallow geophysical method, GPR works by an antenna sending high-frequency electromagnetic waves into the earth in a manner resembling seismic or sonar imaging. These radio waves reflect against contrasting properties in the subsurface, causing some of the energy to be reflected and some to be directed further into the ground. Energy reflected to the surface is captured and recorded by the instrument.
  The GPR geophysical method was selected because of its portability and maneuverability through the field area, along with its recent success in imaging the subsurface in a geophysical study at the City of Flagstaff’s LM-8 wellsite (Bills et al, 2020). A 250-hertz GPR antenna was used to collect # GPR Lines on (DATE #1) and 22 GPR lines on (DATE #2). These were collected perpendicular to areas of interest.
three areas were defined as the North sinkhole complex, South sinkhole complex, both sides of the levee break, and locations of new sinkholes catalogued. The GPR antenna allowed for high resolution imaging of the shallow subsurface, up to a max depth of 4 meters at all sites. Saturated clay-rich topsoil may have contributed to lesser returns. An Emlid Flow differential GPS was used in partnership with the Antenna to track precise movements of the GPR antenna.
  Include?: In a similar GPR study at Lake Mary, the authors reported consistently reaching depths of 42 m (140 ft) (Bills et. al, 2020). While this is not deep enough to image rock units in the regional aquifer, it is sufficient to verify that surface expressions of fractures extend deep into the subsurface to warrant further investigation (Bills et. al, 2020).
