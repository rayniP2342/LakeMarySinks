# This is the outline for a draft paper of Lake Mary Sink hole analysis

**Intro**
- Location: Flagstaff, Colorado Plateau
- - add site map with locations of GPR and LiDAR
- Geology: lithology and structural trends
  The study area is in Northern Arizona, 15 km (9.4 miles) southeast of the City of Flagstaff. The region is part of the Colorado Plateau which spans the four corners region of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona and is characterized by considerable uplift which predominantly took place during the Laramide Orogeny in the Late Cretaceous (REFERENCE).
  The study area overlaps with the San Francisco Volcanic field, which covers about 4,700 km 2 (1,800 mi 2 ) in the areas between Williams AZ, Flagstaff AZ, and the Grand Canyon (USGS, 2018). Basalt flows from cinder cones and other volcanic eruptions cap the local Moenkopi formation and Kaibab limestone. Thin layers of Quaternary alluvium accumulate at various thicknesses in local low points like Marshall Lake and the nearby Lake Mary. Few geological units are present within the study area, as Lower Lake Mary is comprised of Quaternary alluvium in the lake bed and adjacent elevations, and Permian Kaibab Limestone outcrops in the eastern parts of the study area. No basalt flows are present within the study area.
- add site map with geology
The study area falls within a region characterized by extremely high occurrences of jointing (Chavez et al, 1997). More recent evidence from drill logs, and several geophysical investigations provided additional evidence for the depth, and direction of these joints (Bills et.al, 2020).
Faulting within the Lake Mary Graben and wider Colorado Plateau sees trends of faults running in two directions, northeast and northwest. While only the southwestern edge of the Lake Mary graben is presently identified in the study area, known sinkholes also follow this pattern.
Bills et al (2020) also provided a conceptual model for reverse drag structures propegating from deeper crust through through the surface.
